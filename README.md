## ✨ Overview

This **NLP assignment/project** from **DS & AI Cohort 13** explores **sentiment analysis** on **50,000 IMDB movie reviews**.  
The goal: turn messy human text into **structured insights** and train a machine to detect sentiment.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊 for data manipulation  
- **NLTK** 📝 for text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords removal  
- **Scikit-Learn** ⚙️ for vectorization and modeling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈 for visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation  
- **Machine Learning:** Multinomial Naive Bayes  

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** lowercase, punctuation removal, stopwords, stemming, lemmatization  
- **Feature Engineering:** Bag of Words & CountVectorizer  
- **Context Capture:** unigrams, bigrams, trigrams  
- **Modeling:** Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score & Confusion Matrix  

---

## 💡 Insights & Learnings

- Language is emotional — preprocessing and feature engineering are **critical**  
- Simple models like **Naive Bayes** can perform surprisingly well  
- **N-grams and vectorization** improve context understanding  
- Data science is about **empathy as much as algorithms**  

---

## 🎯 Future Work

- Try **TF-IDF** & **Word Embeddings**
